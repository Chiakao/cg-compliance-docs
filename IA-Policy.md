# Procedures

Identity and authentication in cloud.gov is entirely gated by cloud.gov's User Account and Authentication (UAA) Servers and their integration with GSA SecureAuth. Authentication to the underlying Amazon Web Service (AWS) is through the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

For both UAA and IAM endpoints, user accounts are coupled to their federal government identities, represented by their personal identity verification (PIV) card, and all of the verification that process entails. UAA and IAM require multi-factor authentication (MFA) across the board. MFA devices are segmented between the two services, helping to ensure security through diversity. Further, cloud.gov adopts a "zero-trust" network posture - no networks are trusted, unless valid credentials (inclusive of MFA) are authenticated.

See IA-2, IA-2(1), IA-2(2), IA-2(3), IA-2(5), IA-2(8), IA-2(11), IA-2(12), IA-3, IA-4, IA-4(4), IA-5, IA-5(1), IA-5(2), IA-5(3), IA-5(4), IA-5(6), IA-5(7), IA-5(11), IA-6.

As a result of implementing easy integration with customer enterprise identity systems, cloud.gov helps agencies centrally manage identities and supports the use of PIV-card enabled systems, if applicable.

IA-8, IA-8(1), IA-8(2), IA-8(3), IA-8(4).

IA-5(7): cloud.gov ensures that unencrypted static authenticators are not embedded in applications or access scripts or stored on function keys by requiring all team members who use Git to managed code to:

  a. install [caulking](https://github.com/cloud-gov/caulking) during their onboarding process
  b. demonstrate compliance during their onboarding
  c. demonstrate compliance quarterly during biweekly architecture review
